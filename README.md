The Green Start Application helps to address three major problems of school. 

1) Attendance
-
Schools have poor attendance and no strict attendance tracking mechanisms, resulting in higher dropout rates.

2) Homework
-
Majority of students in govt. schools do not have a formal homework structure which 
discourages them to learn at home.

3) Discipline
-
No focus provided on behavioral changes as most of the items are provided by the govt.
These problems are transferred into measurable parameters and stars are warded.
